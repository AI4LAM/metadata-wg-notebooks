[]{#anchor-4}Notes

1.  Introductions
2.  Presentation by Kat Thornton, modeling and use cases around metadata
    surrounding machine learning and training data. Kat's work is
    adjacent, using Wikidata for software emulation. Purpose for
    creating metadata and curated through Wikidata for use by others
    outside the group.
3.  In-browser emulation of software titles in Yale's collection, no
    longer have software/environment available to run. Get data into and
    out of these legacy applications, Kat's provide metadata software
    formats and titles.
4.  Wikidata as a data garden. Right around 1 year mark of global
    pandemic, source of health and balance engaging with the natural
    world, taking the garden as inspiration, think about Wikidata as a
    data garden. Watch it grow and then harvest the results. "Data
    seed", creating new items in Wikidata and adding statements to
    existing items.
5.  Many gardens collaboration in Wikidata. Other , multi-lingual
    support in Wikidata over 300 languages, even if they aren't speaking
    or know about other gardeners. Other editors plant or tend data in
    other domains. Kat focused on Computing, complementary domains from
    other like scholarly publications, many millions of publications
    described in Wikidata, create connections between articles with
    software being used in these articles.
6.  In terms of data harvest, SPARQL queries get specific data baskets
    and then see what is available and watch how changes over time.
    Produce from these garden can be harvested at any and amount.
7.  Data changed in the domain in Computing in 2016 11,055 software
    described in wikidata, now over 85,000 large increase in activity
    and curation. Before there 400 file formats now over 5,000
8.  RDF graph, mulit-lingual expands the use, property names and items
    can be stored in multiple languages. Label and descriptions
    translations uneven distributed in wikidata over human language,
9.  Portal for Wikidata for Digital Preservation, portal pulls from
    Wikidata API and SPARQL endpoint. Example of searching for Debian.
    Language drop-down, switch to property names translated into the
    language. Wikidata multi-language supported in third party more
    useful for more people. International preservation community has
    more access to metadata available in Wikidata.
10. Why create an RDF data layer? RDF datasets can be automatically
    combined, RDF is appropriate for evolving data models. Advantage of
    SPARQL, ability to write very precise queries for work supporting
    other external systems. Ask complex questions about the data, over
    900 software titles have user manuals available on the web. SPARQL
    query for software titles that have manuals, results have links to
    manuals across the web.
11. Over 20,000 scientific articles that reference 900 software titles,
    dozens of file formats connected to their defining standard. More
    than 1,500 RFC connected to technologies/formats they describe. Many
    editors continually contribute to these items to increase coverage.
    Really nice for people doing computing research tied to software
    formats, can provide access to WIkidata and do not need to be
    stored. Experts can specify how formats are used in what software
    and help create connections in wikidata, easy to point users for
    further information to do research.
12. Graph visualization of software emulators that are linked and are
    available in the Easy system. Can click on these nodes and get
    information from running those queries on Wikidata and make the
    system more feature rich.
13. WIkidata for Cultural Heritage Buzz, LoC now using Wikidata
    authority data, ARL white paper, OCLC's using WIkidata Creating
    Library Linked Data in a production system. Other national libraries
    using Wikidata to manage their library data or their wikibase and
    have written up their results.
14. How do we improve the quality of Wikidata? Multiple models,
    constraint violations, Wikidata designed to accommodate multiple
    epistemological models, community-based systems to nudge people to
    collaborate on data models. Early days in building tools around data
    quality in Wikidata, common experience creative exploratory SPARQL
    queries to see if the Wikidata can meet their needs. New namespace
    in Wikidata, schema namespace, "e", share models in shape
    expressions formal modelling and shape for RDF
    [*http://shex.io*](http://shex.io), example Schema for vr headset in
    Wikidata schema namespace. Test for conformance and test namespace.
    Relative new but very promising approach for modeling data in
    WIkidata. Very exciting to have this global data store, more useful
    for producers and consumers can agree.
15. Question: Wikidata constantly being used in ML community, columns in
    tables entity-linking in Wikidata. Kinds of software applications
    represented in Wikidata, representation of ML models, codes, BERT
    and other, resources along with papers, datasets linking, etc.?
    WIkidata expand out to larger documentation of AI space?\
    \
    Some of that in Wikidata, a lot of more work to be done. Not of
    aware of anyone who is creating links to all resources mentioned in
    an article. Possibility is there but a more is needed. EaaSE project
    looking on legacy software past, other people are focusing on
    current software. WikiProject Informatics can post interesting
    questions, ask or encourage people to do more work on this, post
    question. Infrastructure is there for supporting, properties
    specific for datasets and connecting to publications. Not being
    systemically curated right now.\
    \
    What work that would like? Write a bot framework, PyWiki data and
    other custom bots, take the json formats and programmatically update
    Wikidata as more work.\
    \
    Is the wikidata comfortable with the relatively sparse metadata?
    Authors, dates, not, create scaffold for other data updates over
    time? Write a set of inter-connection of bots combine to be a
    richer, suggest posting to WikiProject Informatics, help with
    curation to be more througal.
16. Question: How tricky version can be? Software with different
    properties with different versions of software? Talk about software
    and version with different items, 30-40 versions of different file
    formats. For software there is more variability, legacy software ok
    with different versions. For open-source software link to Github for
    other versions, different versions stored in tabular format with
    different links and date. Table-based version approach was more
    optimal for some software. EaaE, really want to know, ex: these
    versions of ClarisWork, these files will work, later versions may
    have different properties. Priority needs of researcher, discussion
    on the wikidata, some degree of messiness of dealing with WIkidata
    ecosystem, require some work. Wikidata a much younger project than
    20-year Wikipedia.
17. Question: Model Cards concerned about ethical considerations of
    models bias with different attributes, MC have a narrative
    component, piece of documentation for each model, mix of structured
    and very broad narrative. Wikidata approach for MC? Room for
    leverage Wikipedia for narrative component? Wikipedia challenge of
    modeling for one article for Model cards, or create articles per
    model card. Some structured and unstructured, different type of
    repository and create per model card item. Link out with a property
    that links out to the narrative. If MC is published a publication,
    create metadata in wikidata and link out to the publication item and
    require user to go out the narrative repo.\
    \
    Mentioned tabular data in MC, MC have summary tables, properties for
    recording tabular data? How will stored? Will have to create new
    properties, Wikidata community would be interested in collaborative.
    They won't be opposed to these, editors interested and lively
    conversations. Create own Wikibase for MC and create as many
    properties as we want, use subset of Wikidata properties that make
    sense. Trade-off, make WIkibase move fast and create model. Interim
    step and show community and about properties. Ethical considerations
    for MC, too important and need to be included in Wikidata, trade-off
    propose properties and negotiate structure. Tabular property, not
    widely used in property namespace. Example was only used in Software
    versions. In some software items, software version property. Earlier
    software p348 software is a string, p4669 has english label of
    tabular data version, data is tabular. Tabular data type not widely
    used. Propose tabular structure takes more careful discussion and
    justification, property proposal may be more involved.\
    \
    How many properties did you create? Some more difficult to be
    proposed? Any other suggestions? Yes, created properties related to
    digital preservation work, pretty straightforward only a couple of
    weeks. External identifier is the easiest to be approved, point to
    resource on the web. Usually the Wikidata open to external
    identifiers. Other types of properties take more conversations. In
    file formats, patterns some further qualifiers, know pattern and
    know what qualifier, like encoding. Offset, indicate point location
    in file. Without these qualifiers, less useful for external tools.
    More complicated and different qualifiers set, used by different
    tools and workflows. Can be complicated, also proposed properties
    for non-digital preservation, harder to be approved. Lot of factors,
    properties proposal review process more thoroughly, some people or
    more focused on who proposed and what volume and quality of what an
    individual contributed can be taken in account. 20,000 users make at
    least one action in Wikidata per month, at any given time, not even
    a dozen users engaged in properties proposal. Property namespace and
    engage with these proposals. Who is reviewing these proposal.
    Special class of account, can be property creator role to create a
    property.

\
Next steps? Available for follow-up? Yes!

Cory Model Card related topic, data nutrition labels? Data nutrition
project [*https://datanutrition.org/*](https://datanutrition.org/) very
cool.
