# Tools for Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence

## Natural Language Processing (NLP)

- [spaCy](https://spacy.io/), https://spacy.io - spaCy is a free, open-source library for advanced Natural 
Language Processing (NLP) in Python.


## Frameworks 
- [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/), https://huggingface.co/ - Build, train and deploy state of the art models powered by 
the reference open source in machine learning.

- [pyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), https://pytorch.org - PyTorch is an open source machine learning library based on the Torch library, 
used for applications such as computer vision and natural language processing, primarily developed by Facebook's AI Research lab.
It is free and open-source software released under the Modified BSD license.

- [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), https://www.tensorflow.org/ - TensorFlow is a free and open-source software library for
machine learning and artificial intelligence. It can be used across a
range of tasks but has a particular focus on training and inference
of deep neural networks. Tensorflow is a symbolic math library based
on dataflow and differentiable programming.
